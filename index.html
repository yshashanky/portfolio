                            <p>Hi, my name is Pascal van Gemert I'm a Creative / Full Stack Developer from the Netherlands. Over the years I developed a skill set in a range of technologies and frameworks, including Laravel, VueJS and Tailwind. Where I really value clean and readable code. Also I'm passionate about UX / UI. And last but not least, I am the proud father of two boys. I enjoy playing sports and I'm a little bit of a geek now and then.</p>
